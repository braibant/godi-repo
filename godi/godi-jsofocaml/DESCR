Js_of_ocaml is a compiler of OCaml bytecode to Javascript. It makes it possible
to run Ocaml programs in a Web browser.
Its key features are the following: 
 * The whole language, and most of the standard library are supported.
 * The generated code is independant of Eliom and the Ocsigen server. You can 
 use it with any Web server.
 * You can use a standard installation of OCaml to compile your programs. In 
 particular, you do not have to recompile a library to use it with Js_of_ocaml. 
 You just have to link your program with a specific library to interface with 
 the browser APIs.
