OSpec is a Behavior-Driven Development tool for OCaml, inspired by RSpec, a
Ruby BDD library. It is implemented as a Camlp4 syntax extension.

This is a work in progress and should be considered beta quality.

Note: OSpec requires OCaml >= 3.10.0 to run. On versions below 3.11.0, though,
there are two limitations due to OCaml toplevel bugs:

* If you want to use helpers in your specifications (see below), you must
  explicitely "open Helpers" at the top of every specification file.

* Running the "ospec" command with multiple files as arguments doesn't work.
