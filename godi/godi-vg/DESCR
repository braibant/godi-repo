Declarative 2D vector graphics for OCaml

Vg is an OCaml module for declarative 2D vector graphics. In Vg,
images are values that denote functions mapping points of the
cartesian plane to colors. The module provides combinators to define
and compose these values.

Renderers for PDF, SVG and the HTML canvas are distributed with the
module. An API allows to implement new renderers.

Vg depends only on Gg. The SVG renderer has no dependency, the PDF
renderer depends on Uutf and Otfm, the HTML canvas renderer depends on
js_of_ocaml. Vg and its renderers are distributed under the BSD3
license.
