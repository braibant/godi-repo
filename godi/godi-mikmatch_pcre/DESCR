Mikmatch/Micmatch is a Camlp4-based syntax extension of OCaml which extends
the match-with construct with regexps for quick and simple text
manipulation. The syntax of the regexps is an extension of the syntax of
OCamllex regexps, which are easy to learn and OCaml-friendly. Mikmatch_pcre
takes advantage of most of the advanced features of the PCRE library,
including laziness, possessiveness, and lookahead and lookbehind
assertions. The compilation of regexps is performed internally and once
only. If the program is compiled successfully, then your regexps are valid,
as well as the named captures, otherwise the preprocessor reports the error
accurately. Mikmatch with a K is for the new Camlp4 while Micmatch with a C
is for Camlp5.
