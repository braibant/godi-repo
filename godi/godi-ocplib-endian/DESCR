Optimised functions to read and write int16/32/64 from strings and
bigarrays, based on new primitives added in version 4.01.

The library implements two modules:

    EndianString works directly on strings, and provides submodules
    BigEndian and LittleEndian, with their unsafe counter-parts;

    EndianBigstring works on bigstrings (Bigarrays of chars), and
    provides submodules BigEndian and LittleEndian, with their unsafe
    counter-parts;
