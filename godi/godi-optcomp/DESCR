optcomp - optional compilation with cpp-like directives

Optcomp is a syntax extension which handles #if, #else, ... directives
in ocaml source files.

For example, to switch between two pieces of code according to the
ocaml compiler version, one can write:

#if ocaml_version < (3, 10)
let x = 1
#else
let x = 2
#endif
