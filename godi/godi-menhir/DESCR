Menhir compiles LR(1) grammar specifications down to Objective Caml code.
It accepts legacy ocamlyacc grammar specifications, with a few caveats. It
is superior to ocamlyacc in several ways. For instance, it offers a library
of standard parameterized definitions, including options, sequences, and
lists, and allows users to define their own parameterized nonterminal
symbols. It accepts LR(1) grammars, as opposed to only LALR(1) grammars,
and attempts to explain conflicts in a readable way. See the reference
manual for a more detailed overview of Menhir.
