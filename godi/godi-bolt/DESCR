Bolt is a logging tool for the OCaml language. It is inspired by and
modeled after the famous log4j logging framework for Java.

Bolt is highly customizable and features a camlp4-based syntax
extension (introducing a LOG msg LEVEL lvl expression) that allows to
remove all logging statements to produce distributed executables that
dot not incur any performance penalty for logging statements used
during the development stage.
