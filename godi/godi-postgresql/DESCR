What is PostgreSQL-OCaml?

This OCaml-library provides an interface to PostgreSQL, an efficient
and reliable, open source, relational database. Almost all
functionality available through the C-API (libpq) is replicated in a
type-safe way. This library uses objects for representing database
connections and results of queries.  Usage

The OCaml-API in file lib/postgresql.mli is well-documented and can be
built as HTML with make doc. The API-documentation can also be found
online.

More detailed information on how to interact with PostgreSQL is
available in the PostgreSQL-documentation. The OCaml-examples in the
examples-directory are mostly very short and comprehensible and
therefore a good way to get started.
