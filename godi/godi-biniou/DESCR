Biniou is a binary data format designed for speed, safety, ease of use and
backward compatibility as protocols evolve.  Biniou is vastly equivalent to
JSON in terms of functionality but allows implementations about 4 times as
fast (see godi-yojson for comparison), with 25-35% space savings.  Biniou
data can be decoded into human-readable form without knowledge of type
definitions except for field and variant names which are represented by
31-bit hashes.
