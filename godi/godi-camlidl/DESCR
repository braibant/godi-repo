Camlidl is a stub code generator for Objective Caml.  It generates
stub code for interfacing Caml with C from an IDL description of the C
functions.  Thus, Camlidl automates the most tedious task in
interfacing C libraries with Caml programs.  It can also be used to
interface Caml programs with other languages, as long as those
languages have a well-defined C interface.

In addition, Camlidl provides basic support for COM interfaces and
components under MS Windows.  It supports both using COM components
(usually written in C++ or C) from Caml programs, and packaging Caml
objects as COM components that can then be used from C++ or C.
