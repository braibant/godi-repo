Mascot is a style-checker for OCaml sources. It provides checks in
various categories: code, documentation, interface, metrics, and
typography. The goal of the tool is to allow a (team of) developer(s)
to enforce style properties over a source codebase for greater
coherency and style uniformity. The tool is highly customizable,
allowing one to choose the checks to perform, as well as exceptions to
those checks in given files. Moreover, a plugin system allows the
developer to add its own checks, and output modes.  Bundled output
modes range from bare text to CheckStyle- and JDepend-compatible XML
file in order to allow integration with Jenkins.
