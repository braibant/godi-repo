The original reference manual and the tutorial for Camlp4. This refers 
to the Camlp4 version shipped until O'Caml 3.09 (which is still 
separately available as "Camlp5"). The Camlp4 version in 3.10 was 
rewritten from scratch. However, many of the interfaces and concepts 
described in this manual are still applicable.

An "appendix" to this manual is available in godi-gallium-docs, which is 
a copy of the wiki at http://brion.inria.fr/gallium, and these docs 
somehow describe the changes in the rewritten Camlp4.
