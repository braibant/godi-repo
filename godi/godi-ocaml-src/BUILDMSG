Available options for godi.conf:

- OCAML_CONF_ARGS: Further options for the configure script

- OCAML_SVN_CHECKOUT: If you want to check out the O'Caml sources
  from Subversion, set this variable to "yes". Of course, you need the
  svn utility to do this.

  If enabled, the revision number of this package is changed to 99,
  i.e. 4.00 would be changed into 4.00godi99.

- OCAML_SVN_ARGS: Pass here additional arguments to the svn
  call.

- OCAML_SVN_PATH: The revision to check out:
   - /ocaml/trunk:           latest development version
   - /ocaml/version/3.11     latest update of this release
   - /ocaml/release/3.11.1   exactly this release

- OCAML_BUILD_FLAGS: Optimisation flags you want to pass to the compiler 
                     instead of -O (mingw only)
   
godi-ocaml-src configures also the godi-ocaml-* packages,
but these packages will not be rebuilt automatically
(select them manually).
