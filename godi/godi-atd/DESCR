ATD stands for Adjustable Type Definitions.  It is a type definition
language designed to accomodate a variety of programming languages and data
formats by the means of target-specific annotations.  It supports sum
types, parametrized types and inheritance.  The library provides a parser
and other tools useful for manipulating ATD type definitions.  The
reference manual gives a complete description of the syntax.
