GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor - and more. At its
core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp
programming language with extensions to support text editing.

This is a native windows version of emacs. Tuareg, caml-mode,
cygwin-mount, and color-theme are pre-installed.
