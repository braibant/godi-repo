What is OCamltop-gtk ?

OCamltop-gtk is a Gtk2 graphical interface for the OCaml
toplevel. Like the text mode toplevel, it permits interactive use of
the OCaml system through a read-eval-print loop. Some additional
functionalities are provided:

    saving the input code into a file, viewing and browsing of
    computed values in a tree-oriented view, easy access to
    definitions of values, modules, types, ....

One can also create his own graphical toplevel with the tool
mk-ocamltop-gtk.

OCamltop-gtk was previously part of Cameleon under the name
"topcameleon" but is now developped separately and is findlib
compatible.
