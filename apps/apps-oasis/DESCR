OASIS is a Cabal like system for OCaml, It uses findlib for libraries and
ocamlbuild for building.

It helps to create a full and portable build system for OCaml libraries and
applications:
* configure: check build environment
* build
* install/uninstall

Planned supported build tool: OMake and OCamlMakefile
